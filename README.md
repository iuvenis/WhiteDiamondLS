# WhiteDiamond - Lockscreen

I wanted to create a sharp little module that would display the time on my phone and also have an indicator as to the battery percentage left.

Clock:

Text based clock with the day of the week and date displayed.
May add weather info as well.

Battery:

The battery indicator is currently the circles on the sides of the diamonds, their opacity is lowered as the phone's charge goes down until a "Low Bat." warning appears on the sides when 10% remains.
